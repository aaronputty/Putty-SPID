# Putty SPID
This includes a bunch of SPID and KID configuration for my Skyrim Setup. It currently has:

## Obody configuration for HIMBO males

## SPID armor customization for the following mods:

Khajiit Has Wears
Armors of the Velothi
Guard Armor Replacer
Sons of Skyrim
Heavy Legion

This allows you to keep any female armors that you are probably skimpifying while also appliying the fancy new armor to male characters. A small percentage of female NPCs will also get the new armor but chances are, if you've got a setup based on LSAR-ing female armor, this will allow women to keep the skimpified vanilla armor.

## Keyword customization for Animated Armory using Dear Diary keywords

- Added Katana keyword to "Akaviri Katana" in base game
- Added Katana keyword to the named swords gotten at the end of "Way of the Nine" quest from Interesting NPCs

## Added scimitar keyword from Scimitar Tweaks and Patches (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/84759) to:
- The new scimitars added by Ryn's Snazzy Last Vigil (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76385)

## Building

If you want to build this, just zip that data folder up and drag/drop it into Vortex.
